# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Yi Qian**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  One challenge I encountered in creating this submission is to merge three files in three different language together to run a website. 
Usually when I deal with a programing project, I only code in one language. The only case that I need to know more than one language is 
when I write a compiler that translate one language to another since it is necessary for me to understand both languages well in order to 
translate them. However, to complete this submission, I need at least three files in different languages to serve different purpose. Each 
of the three languages interacts with each other in different ways. When I first look through the requirements and tasks, I was worried if 
I cannot handle three languages that I was not familiar with yet. In order to complete this project, I looked up some tutorial videos on 
YouTube on how to successfully program in HTML and JS. After I watched these tutorial videos and did some practice problems, I figured out 
what is going on in these source files. Specifically, I used the console.log() function and the console on my browser to monitor what and 
when does each function output during runtime. By doing that, I had a better understanding of the structure of the program.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  After I have completing this submission, I have some question about web development regarding how it actually works. When I code in 
  other languages such as C++, the code will not run itself, but needs to be on an application platform like an IDE that reads and compiles 
  the code. However, a website does not seem to need a compiler and can be run on almost every browser. I am wondering how the way HTML is 
  run different from programming languages, and what benefit does it bring by working in that way? I think knowing more about how it works 
  can help me do a better job such as proving the running time.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to add more additional features to the game. I have attempted to add a 
  timer or a clock that limits playersâ€™ thinking time. However, I faced some troubles since the setInterval() method was not functioning as 
  I thought. I have tried many ways trying to solve it, including placing it in different code blocks, but neither of them worked. As my 
  coursework getting heavier every day, I have less spare time and could not find a way to do it by the deadline. In addition, if I have more 
  time, I may change the sound of the buttons after pressing since the default sound is a bit piercing, and I was thinking about changing it 
  to something less noisy such as the sound of a xylophone.
